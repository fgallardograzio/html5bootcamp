/*
To add weight to this declaration block, first we must apply it directly to the elements we wish to style,
otherwise its properties will be inherited, and overridden by the local declarations.

By setting the font-size property of the HTML element, all the other elements of the document are going to
inherit it, but no matter how much weight we gave to the declaration, the values specified using the class
selector will act directly on the specified elements with the given class, and have a higher priority.

However, if we were to use a different selector, like 'html *', we would be targeting every descendant of
the HTML element directly.
Now we'd have two declarations applied to the same element, but the latter would have a higher specificity
and still take precedence.

To increase the specificity of the first one we could add a class to the HTML element, and have a selector
such as 'html.my-document *'.
This declaration would now have a higher specificity and be applied to every element in the document tree.

Other alternatives to increase the specificity consist of using a pseudo-class in the selector, such as
'html:root *', which would be redundant but would serve its purpose, or we could use an id selector.

We could also add the '!important' keyword, and we wouldn't have to worry about specificity, but of course
the selector must be applied directly to the element as well, as said earlier.
